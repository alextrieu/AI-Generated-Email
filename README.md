## Introduction
I built this form to enhance my web development skills and explore new technologies. The main goal of this project was to practice working with APIs and utilize various web development techniques to build a powerful and user-friendly form.

To achieve this, I incorporated Axios, a library that enables easy communication with other web servers, to add data to the form. Additionally, I implemented conditional rendering to dynamically display content based on specific conditions or user input, making the form more intuitive and user-friendly.

Furthermore, I ensured that the form was controlled, which means that user input was managed in real-time, providing instant feedback and reducing errors.

In summary, this project was an exciting and challenging opportunity for me to experiment with new web development techniques and build a functional and user-friendly AI outreach email form.
